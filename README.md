## Outside coding
I'm curious about almost all scientific fields, in particular I'm very passionate about astronomy and astrophysics 🛰<br>
I really enjoy visiting natural places 🌄, watching anime, listening to pop/jpop/dance/synth music 🎵 and taking care of cats 😸<br>
And of course I love playing videogames! 🎮
